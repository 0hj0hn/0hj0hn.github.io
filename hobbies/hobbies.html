                <h2>Badminton</h2>
                <p>I like playing badminton in my free time. I have started playing badminton since middle school and up until now.
                    Furthermore, I competed in many tournaments and won awards. I still enjoy playing after coming to Madison, where
                    I don't play much as before when I was in Saipan.

                <h2>Bass Guitar</h2>
                <p>I love listening to music which is why I started to play Bass Guitar. I love it. In my free time, I pick a song 
                    that I have been listening to and listen to it. I also play for my church worship team every Sunday which is also
                    a great way to practice.
