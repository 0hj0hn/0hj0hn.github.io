                <h2>Hangang River, South Korea</h2>
                <p> South Korea is a country that I visit often which I consider it my second country following my ethnicity. I 
                    enjoy going to this peaceful river watching the sunset and watching the night view of the lights nearby.

                <h2>Hollywood, Los Angeles</h2>
                <p>I visit California quite often and I enjoy going to the hollywood sign. It feels like I am in a movie and
                    the nice weather makes it a good place to vist. California is a state that I hope to live in the future and
                    I hope to visit all the national parks. I went to the following places in California besides Hollywood
                <ul>
                    <li>Golden Gate Bridge</li>
                    <li>Death Valley</li>
                    <li>Joshua Tree</li>
                    <li>Lake Tahoe</li>
                    <li>LACMA</li>

                <h2>Washington Monument, DC</h2>
                <p> District of Columbia was an intersting place to visit and view the history of United States. I definitely
                    learned a lot and watching the monuments interested me a lot. Hoping to go back on spring to watch the 
                    cherry blossoms.

                <h2><b>Times Square, New York</b></h2>
                <p> One of the busiest and a famous tourist destination that is at the intersection of the middle of Manhattan. I 
                    think it is one of the places that should be visited if one plans to go to New York with the various theaters 
                    along Broadway. This is another place I want to visit during New Years for the New Year's Eve Ball despite
                    the crowd.
